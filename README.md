# CellTag-multi-2023
Code to re-produce major plots and analyses from the CellTag-multi paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01931-4

Most of the processed single-cell datasets can be found here: https://figshare.com/projects/CellTag-multi_2023_DataShare/173508

Raw sequencing data and counts matrices are deposited on GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE216521

The processed scATAC and scRNA objects for the iEP reprogramming lineage tracing time course are unavailable on Figshare due to their large size. Please email us at s.morris@wustl.edu and we would be happy to share those datasets
